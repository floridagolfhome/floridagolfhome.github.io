<p><strong>This stunning villa has a south facing pool</strong> with an extra large deck area that is large enough for the whole family to enjoy. It overlooks the 'Ladies tee' on the 17th fairway allowing wonderful views of both the sunrise and the sunsets</p>

<p><strong>Being south facing</strong> we get the sun on at least part of the deck all day, this is particularly important in the autumn and winter months. The lanai shelters you from the occasional cool winter breezes, whilst capturing the heat from the sun. In the summer with the sun higher, the lanai and with our huge sun umbrella offer shade. This area is protected from insects by a mesh screen which still allows the sun in</p>

<p><strong>The luxury hydro spa</strong> is fitted on the pool deck. With its LED mood lighting and 34 jets, this is a perfect way to ease your aching muscles after all those park rides!</p>

<p><strong>Four comfortable sun beds</strong> are provided and a table and chairs for dining alfresco are under the covered lanai which is fitted with a ceiling fan to keep you cool on those warm nights. We also offer a George Foreman BBQ/Grill for alfresco dining. All doors and windows to the pool are fitted with child alarms</p>

<p><strong>The pool is solar heated</strong> year round. Electric pool heating is available for the autumn and winter months (recommended Nov to Mar)</p>

<p><strong>The games room</strong> has a Pool Table, Air Hockey, Shuffleboard and soft tip electronic Darts Board. All are suitable for adult and child use. Full sized and children's pool cues are provided</p>

<p><strong>The spacious family room</strong> overlooking the pool and golf course has plenty of seating for your party, including a queen sized sofa bed. There is a 50" flat screen digital cable TV and CD player as well as the lovely view. <strong>Digital cable</strong> gives you extra stations including UK sport channels and many with fewer adverts</p>

<p><strong>There are two dining areas</strong> seating ten in total, but we prefer to eat outside by the pool. The covered lanai is a wonderful place to eat breakfast and watch the sunrise</p>

<p><strong>The kitchen</strong> is fully equipped with dishwasher, microwave and a fridge/freezer with ice-maker and filtered water dispenser. All cooking utensils, crockery, cutlery and glassware are provided. In the utility area we have a washing machine, separate dryer, iron and ironing board</p>

<p><strong>This beautiful home has four double bedrooms and three bathrooms, three of the bedrooms have double beds making it perfect for couples to share</strong></p>

<p><strong>The master suite</strong> has an en-suite shower room which has its own door to the pool area, a king sized bed with an incredibly comfortable memory foam mattress, ceiling fan, cable TV and walk-in wardrobe</p>

<p><strong>The second master suite</strong> to the front has queen sized bed en-suite bathroom, digital cable TV, ceiling fan and large wardrobe</p>

<p><strong>The third bedroom</strong> has one double and one twin bed, ample wardrobe space and digital cable TV</p>

<p><strong>The fourth bedroom</strong> has two twin beds, ample wardrobe space and digital cable TV. These two rooms share a third full bathroom</p>

<p>All bed linen and towels are provided for your stay. Each bed has a spare set of linen and if you don't want to change it yourself, we can arrange for a mid stay clean, although there would be a charge for this service</p>

<p>All pool towels are provided and the bathrooms have hair dryers. We offer free international and long distance phone calls at the villa plus free high speed wifi connection</p>

<p>For our smaller guests we have a travel cot, highchair and stroller</p>
