<p><strong>This stunning villa has a south facing pool</strong> with an extra large deck area that is large enough for the whole family to enjoy. It overlooks the 'Ladies tee' on the 17th fairway allowing wonderful views of both the sunrise and the sunsets</p>

<p><strong>Being south facing</strong> we get the sun on at least part of the deck all day, this is particularly important in the autumn and winter months. The lanai shelters you from the occasional cool winter breezes, whilst capturing the heat from the sun. In the summer with the sun higher, the lanai and with our huge sun umbrella offer shade. This area is protected from insects by a mesh screen which still allows the sun in</p>

<p><strong>The luxury hydro spa</strong> is fitted on the pool deck. With its LED mood lighting and 34 jets, this is a perfect way to ease your aching muscles after all those park rides!</p>

<p><strong>Four comfortable sun beds</strong> are provided and a table and chairs for dining alfresco are under the covered lanai which is fitted with a ceiling fan to keep you cool on those warm nights. We also offer a George Foreman BBQ/Grill for alfresco dining. All doors and windows to the pool are fitted with child alarms</p>

<p><strong>The pool is solar heated</strong> year round. Electric pool heating is available for the autumn and winter months (recommended Nov to Mar)</p>

<p><strong>The games room</strong> has a Pool Table, Air Hockey, Shuffleboard and soft tip electronic Darts Board. All are suitable for adult and child use. Full sized and children's pool cues are provided</p>

<p><strong>The spacious family room</strong> overlooking the pool and golf course has plenty of seating for your party, including a queen sized sofa bed. There is a 50" flat screen cable TV and CD player as well as the lovely view. <strong>Roku streaming</strong> gives you access to many films and TV shows as well as UK and international sports</p>

<p><strong>There are two dining areas</strong> seating ten in total, but we prefer to eat outside by the pool. The covered lanai is a wonderful place to eat breakfast and watch the sunrise</p>
