<h1>Your Perfect Florida Dream Vacation</h1>

<p>This beautiful four bedroom home with its south facing pool and hydro spa, is located on Southern Dunes Golf and Country Club just 20 minutes from Disney world. With fabulous views over the 17th fairway, both golfers and non golfers will enjoy the beautiful surroundings and friendly peaceful atmosphere.</p>

<p>The versatile accommodation with its two master suites, is the perfect base for your family holiday, either on your own or to share with friends, or why not treat the grandparents! With the spacious living area and oversized pool deck it is also perfect for couples or golfing parties.</p>

<p>Relax in the luxury hydro spa, sun yourself on the south facing pool deck or take a dip in your own private heated pool. We have everything you will need for your dream vacation. There is even a games room with a pool table, air hockey, darts and shuffleboard.</p>

<p>If you can tear yourself away there's a selection of restaurants and bars nearby and the parks are just a short drive. Florida holidays can be exhausting with all the attractions to visit. We feel this villa gives the best of both worlds. Close to the action and yet a wonderful step out from it all. Sit by the pool take in the view and really chill out!!</p>
