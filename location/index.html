<p>Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club is located on Highway 27, just 15 miles south of Disney World.</p>

<p>Designed by Steve Smyers, the award winning golf course opened in 1993. The dramatic hillside layout stretches to over 7,200 yards and features 100ft of elevation changes, not typically found in Central Florida. Five sets of tees welcome golfers of all skill levels.</p>

<p>Southern Dunes Golf Course is consistently ranked among the nation's best and receives rave reviews from local and visiting golfers. It was ranked number 12 in Florida on 'America's best courses you can play.' by GolfWeek (2010)</p>

<p>Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club is a peaceful gated community. The gates are manned 24 hours a day for added security.</p>

<p>Five minutes walk from our villa is the Southern Dunes clubhouse bar and restaurant which offers breakfast, lunch and dinner menus. Booking for dinner is advised.</p>

<p>Just outside the gates of Southern Dunes, within easy walking distance, is a 24 hour Walmart superstore which sells just about anything you can think of, from food to pool toys!</p>

<p>There are also several other smaller shops, banks, fast food and family restaurants, our favourite being the popular Manny's Chophouse.</p>

<p>Eagle Ridge mall is 15 minutes drive away and offers several major stores, such as J C Penney and Sears and a cinema. The Disney parks are just 20 minutes drive.</p>

<p>Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club is an ideal location for your holiday. Whether a golfer or not, you will enjoy the friendly, peaceful atmosphere. Some places maybe a little nearer the action, but that also means you are nearer to the noise and traffic.</p>
